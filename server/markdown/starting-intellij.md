# Starting the Project in IntelliJ IDEA

To start a Gradle project using IntelliJ IDEA, follow these steps:

1. In the project structure window, you should see the structure of your project, including the `build.gradle` file and any subprojects.
2. To build the project, click on the "Gradle" tab in the right panel, then expand the "Tasks" tree and double-click on the "build" task.
   -  ![image-build-gradle](../images/starting-intellij/build.gradle%20in%20intellij.png)

3. To run the project, click on the "Application" menu and select "Run..."
   -  ![image-run](../images/starting-intellij/start%20project%20in%20intellij.png)

4. To run tests, click on the "Verification" menu and select "test"
   -  ![image-running-test](../images/starting-intellij/run%20tests%20in%20intellij.png)

This will build and run the project using the default configuration. If you need to customize the configuration, you can edit the `build.gradle` file and specify the desired options.
